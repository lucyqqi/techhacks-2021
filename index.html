          <p> In Canada, 10.1% of the population is living below the poverty line, which is something that cannot be solved by budgeting alone. We need to change that.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>Wealth inequality is a problem that has been plaguing our society for years now, but it is especially prevalent during times of the pandemic. As the middle class continues to shrink, we see that more and more people are unable to afford basic necessities, decreasing the overall quality of life around the world. Inequality affects everyone, as it also affects the economy negatively. As when wealth is allocated to the hands of the rich, total consumer spending dips, and unemployment skyrockets. Thus, it is crucial that we continue our fight against wealth inequality, not just for the sake of the financially destitute, but for all members of society.</p>

          <h3>Our Mission</h3> 
          <p>  <font size="+3"> <i> Inspire, Educate, Support </font> </i> </p>
          <p>inEQ’s goal is to inspire and educate about the severity of wealth inequality and the action they can take to fight against it. Though many are vaguely aware that the wealth gap exists, they often do not know how it affects poorer classes or the general population. We believe that with education, there comes a desire to take action and change. Our ultimate mission is to help others begin their journey of learning, so that they may begin to take initiative and educate those around them about the problem as well. </p>
