<h4>Main Causes of Inequality</h4>
<p><i>• Opportunity capture, political capture, globalization, technology </i>(replacing jobs, outsourcing of jobs), busting unions (workers trying to protect their rights)</p>
<p>•<i> Connections made about inequality meritocracy</i> (ruling of educational/ skilled/ influential people)</p>
<p>• <i>Rising meritocracy:</i> inequality gap widens, more political capture, government corruptness, downward social mobility</p>

    <h4> General Information </h4>
    <p> According to 2019 statistics, 400 people in the United States have the same wealth as the bottom 50,000,000 of individuals. This is a pressing issue, and the disparity is only getting larger now. In 1978, adjusted for inflation, the middle class had an average income of $48,000 compared with the upper-class of $390,000. In 2010 alone, the middle class had an average income of $33,000 and the upper-class had $1,101,000.</p>

      <p>The middle class are essential to the heart of economic and job growth, and help the economy keep going. They make up the bulk of consumer spending, thus jobs will be created to create the demands that consumers need. The richest people, on the other hand, can only spend so much money, which ends up generating less economic activity globally because the rich put the money into savings and investments. Taxes on investments are very low, which is why tax-cuts on the super rich unfortunately don't help that much. That's why we made this site in the first place, to educate you about income inequality, and advocate for more change from the government!</p>

      <p>The middle class wages are getting lower given the rising inequality throughout, and this means they have less purchasing power, and can't buy as many things as they'd like too. Because of less consumer spending, companies need to lay off workers and there will be fewer jobs.  This is coined the "vicious cycle" where wages stagnate (can't pay taxes and buy stuff), workers buy less, companies downsize, tax revenues decrease, government cuts programs, workers are less educated, unemployment rises, then deficit grows (spending > income). This may be a overgeneralization, but is the general notion of the "vicious cycle." On the other hand, the 'virtuous cycle' means investing in education, educated workforce, better products, larger middle class, more consumption, more workers, and more jobs and tax revenue. </p>

      <p>In addition, globalization and technology play a large role in amplifying the wage gap as well. Globalization allowed manufacturing and construction to be done elsewhere.Technology allows for jobs to be done by machines, hence lower wages. Since manufacturing can be done in places where employers can pay workers less, companies move. If the workers don’t want them to leave, they accept a pay cut/pay freeze.</p>

   <p> This increased inequality correlates with decreased upward social mobility. Since the poor don’t have many opportunities and can’t attend as elite of schooling as the wealthy. Thus, economically disadvantaged kids lose motivation to stay in school and try to climb the hierarchy as the wealth gap increases. While one may argue that higher levels of income equality may incentivize adolescents to work harder, the general notion is that low-income kids usually struggle more and drop out unfortunately. Rich children are generally exposed to more opportunities, allowing them to continue to be successful and dominating all the wealth.</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, extreme inequality threatens democracy. The rich can exploit political capture, using the power of their money to get the government to pass the policies they want. For instance, they can get media outlets to launch campaigns into attack advertisements for opponents. As well, they can abuse wealth by lobbying subsidies (support them financially), which in turn, benefit their wealth.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this is terrible for our economy since the talented cannot rise to the top (low social mobility), the economy is ultimately less innovative and productive. Inequality may discourage people from putting in effort to climb the ladder, undermining work and effort. Rich people could also implement populist policies that harm growth, for everyone. Poor are hit hardest by rising inflation, lower growth, and protectionist policies.

<h4>Definitions</h4>
<p>• <b>Progressive taxation:</b> a tax in which the average tax rate (taxes paid ÷ personal income) increases as the taxable amount increases,  imposes a lower tax rate on low-income earners compared to those with a higher income</p>
<p>• <b>Flat taxation:</b> tax system with a constant marginal rate, same tax rate to every taxpayer regardless of income bracket</p>
<p><b>Essence of democracy: </b> one person one vote</p>
<p>
• <b>Trickle down economics: </b> leave the money at the rich and they’ll spend it, the wealth and prosperity will trickle down </p>
<p>• <b>Opportunity capture: </b> lowest tax rates, the best education, and the best healthcare are claimed by the rich. Advantages for a rich cycle throughout generations.</p>
<p>
<b>• Social mobility:</b> change in social status relative to one's current social location within a given society</p>
<p>• <b>Democracy: </b> a system where government officials are elected by the people</p>
<p>
• <b>Political capture:</b> government failures. An agency that is supposed to act in public interest, instead advantages for the concerns of special interest groups that dominate industry/sector (i.e. rich)</p>
<p>
• <b>Globalization: </b> businesses operate on an international scale 
</p>
<p>
<b>• Social mobility: </b>change in social status relative to one's current social location within a given society
